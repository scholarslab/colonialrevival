         <DIV CLASS="para">The 2003 Web Edition varies slightly from the original manuscript 
            released in 2000, primarily in that more than 40 new citations have been added 
            to the previous 301 annotated entries, and all the Additional Citations have 
            been annotated and folded into the original listing. In the future, the Web 
            Edition of the Colonial Revival Annotated Bibliography may be updated, and 
            should be considered a work-in-progress.

         <DIV CLASS="para">The following bibliography provides scholarly and popular literature 
            that addresses the Colonial Revival in architecture, painting, sculpture, 
            landscape design, decorative arts, furniture, and cultural studies from the 
            1870s to the present. It selectively samples the vast store of Colonial 
            Revival literature, and is intended to be comprehensive, but not all-
            inclusive. Every effort has been made to identify influential works in each 
            area, as well as those that merely demonstrate the breadth or popularity of 
            the style throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.  To this end, a partial 
            listing of popular magazines that encourage decoration or renovation in the 
            Colonial Revival style in distinctly non-scholarly sources can be located 
            after the introductory essay in a footnote for the section, "On the Inclusion 
            of Magazines and Popular Literature."

         <DIV CLASS="para">Most people have a general idea of what is meant by the phrase "Colonial 
            Revival." The words tend to evoke images of Chippendale furniture and Georgian 
            houses. But the Colonial Revival is much more than an architectural or 
            decorative style; it is a physical and psychological manifestation of an ongoing relationship between past and present. Torn between a nostalgic 
            yearning for the past and the seductive promise of the future, Americans are 
            been locked in what Michael Kammen calls "the never-ending dialectic between 
            tradition and progress." <A HREF="index.html#f001"> <sup>1</sup></A> As part of 
            this process, Americans have negotiated a compromise between past and future 
            through the use of colonial imagery. The following bibliography represents an 
            attempt to review the various ways Americans have seen and used the colonial 
            period over the course of almost two centuries.

         <DIV CLASS="para">The Colonial Revival movement, with its roots in a distant past, has 
            helped successive generations of Americans ease the transition into the 
            newness of the present and the uncertainty of the future. Tracing the history 
            of the Colonial Revival through popular and scholarly literature allows us to 
            see how successive generations have chosen to effect a continuation of the 
            colonial period to some extent by venerating antiques or reproducing objects 
            and images inspired by that time. These artistic and cultural renewals have 
            taken many different forms and have been motivated by many different factors. 
            The Colonial Revival peaked in popularity between 1880 and 1940, but it has 
            never really died. In fact, it is probably best thought of as a "survival" 
            rather than a revival. This ongoing attraction is partially due to the 
            widespread adoption of colonial models in many different artistic fields. 
            Examples of the Colonial Revival's flexibility include the popularity of the 
            "modernized" colonial house, historical paintings depicting important 
            Revolutionary scenes, and the continuing attraction of colonial furniture. The 
            longstanding and pervasive appeal of colonial imagery demonstrates its ability 
            to fulfill both symbolic and functional needs. The past, in the form of the 
            ambiguous term "colonial," has been part of a continuous present in the United 
            States for over a century. The literature of the Colonial Revival documents 
            this important relationship.

         <DIV CLASS="para"> A review of the extensive literature on the Colonial Revival reveals a 
            number of trends. Three of the most important are (a) the manner in which the 
            Colonial Revival has been promoted, (b) the various meanings and associations 
            afforded to "colonial" over time, and (c) the reasons for the Colonial 
            Revival's popularity. This essay will briefly address each of these themes.

         <DIV CLASS="para">The promotion of the Colonial Revival has generally followed different 
            patterns within different disciplines. In architecture, for example, three 
            types of writings have done the most to advance the movement in the last 150 
            years: picture- or sketch books; scholarly histories; and "how-to" guides.
            The earliest manifestations of an architectural Colonial Revival after the 
            Civil War took the form of sketchbooks and brief articles in architectural 
            journals. Picturesque old houses, or details such as doorways or stairway 
            balusters, were lovingly rendered by architects attuned to their historical 
            worth. <A HREF="index.html#f002"><sup>2</sup></A> At the same time, brief 
            articles in professional journals praised the simple elegance of colonial 
            building. <A HREF="index.html#f003"> <sup>3</sup></A></DIV> 
         
         
         <DIV CLASS="para">By the end of the nineteenth century, architects were lauding colonial 
            architecture in journal articles and using colonial references in their built 
            work. Architects, not scholars, created the first significant body of 
            historical scholarship on America's colonial architecture. <A HREF="index.html#f004"> <sup>4</sup></A> At the time, the fledgling architectural 
            profession in America had not yet reached a desirable level of organization 
            and social status. This situation influenced early twentieth century 
            architects' attitudes toward the colonial past. Architects made detailed 
            drawings of old buildings, supplemented by historical studies of their 
            construction techniques and artistic lineage. <A HREF="index.html#f005"> 
               <sup>5</sup></A> The chronology and taxonomy of styles occupied most of the 
            work. Much of this activity focused on "high style" colonial architecture 
            rather than everyday or vernacular buildings for an important reason; the 
            great Georgian mansions, with their fine proportions and English details, 
            implied the presence of a trained builder or architect rather than an 
            unskilled carpenter. <A HREF="index.html#f006"> <sup>6</sup></A> Impressive 
            colonial buildings that could be attributed to a skilled designer strengthened 
            the early twentieth century architect's claims for historical legitimacy and 
            continuity. The architect-historian continued to be the most important scholar 
            of colonial architecture into the 1960s. Since then, the Colonial Revival has 
            become the domain of art, architectural and cultural historians.
         </DIV>
         

         
         <DIV CLASS="para">Colonial Revival architecture has also been promoted by a uniquely American 
            type of book - the "how-to" guide. <A HREF="index.html#f007"> <sup>7</sup></A> 
            Readers were advised on issues concerning proper interiors and exteriors for 
            the "colonial" look, to avoid "certain shortcomings recognizable in much of 
            the supposedly-in-the-old-vein modern work." <A HREF="index.html#f008"> 
               <sup>8</sup></A> Although these books peaked in popularity during the 
            interwar period, their spirit continues today in the form of popular magazines 
            - like Colonial Homes and Early American Homes - dedicated to the appropriate 
            decoration and furnishing of a neo-Colonial house.
         </DIV>
         
         
         <DIV CLASS="para">In furniture and the decorative arts, the Colonial Revival has concentrated on 
            objects either inspired by historical items or direct reproductions. This 
            strategy is reflected in a literature that promotes colonial furnishing and 
            decoration through taste guides and house histories. The first promoters of 
            colonial furniture were collectors and antiquarians who focused on the 
            originals and admired their simplicity and proportions. <A HREF="index.html#f009"> 
               <sup>9</sup></A> These early advocates produced books and articles intended 
            to elevate popular taste by providing examples of colonial refinement for 
            adaptation to modern life. <A HREF="index.html#f010"> <sup>10</sup></A> 
            Contemporary designers were urged to follow older models. As the style became 
            more popular, manufacturers like Wallace Nutting began to produce historic 
            reproductions inspired by surviving antiques. <A HREF="index.html#f011"> 
               <sup>11</sup></A> Into the 1950s, popular magazines like House Beautiful 
            and House and Garden were filled with articles on interior decoration that 
            promoted colonial styles, while advertisements touted a wide array of Colonial 
            Revival products. <A HREF="index.html#f012"> <sup>12</sup></A> At the same time, 
            specialized magazines like Antiques advocated the virtues of colonial design 
            and attempted to educate readers in the merits of various colonial
            styles.
         </DIV>
         
         
         <DIV CLASS="para">House histories and picture books were another popular means of promoting the 
            Colonial Revival in the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The 
            typical picture book focused on interior details like fireplaces or wood 
            paneling. <A HREF="index.html#f013"> <sup>13</sup></A> Histories tended to mix 
            the stories of famous houses and families with descriptions of their 
            surroundings. <A HREF="index.html#f014"> <sup>14</sup></A> Both types of books 
            served to increase awareness of colonial design while also subtly or blatantly 
            advocating the colonial idiom as a display of good taste. Until the late 
            twentieth century, however, the colonial revival in the decorative arts 
            avoided serious scholarly investigation. In recent years, historians have 
            attempted to go beyond simple promotion or connoisseurship to ask important 
            questions about the place of furniture, needlework, wallpaper, and other 
            objects in the Colonial Revival movement. <A HREF="index.html#f015"><sup>15</sup></A></DIV>
         
         
         <DIV CLASS="para">The Colonial Revival also affected American landscape and garden design. Due 
            to the perishable nature of plants and a lack of precise documentation, 
            colonial gardens have been difficult to accurately reconstruct. <A HREF="index.html#f016"><sup>16</sup></A> 
            But in the late nineteenth century, a distinct style of garden evolved in America inspired by perceptions of 
            historical colonial gardens. The movement to recreate "grandmother's garden" 
            produced formal, ordered gardens in yards and estates of all sizes. <A HREF="index.html#f017"><sup>17</sup></A></DIV> 
         
         
         <DIV CLASS="para">Colonial-inspired gardens at large estates 
            were frequently exhibited in photographic surveys. <A HREF="index.html#f018"> 
               <sup>18</sup></A> Numerous catalogs, usually produced by local or national 
            garden clubs, extolled the beauty of smaller-scale Colonial Revival gardens. 
            <A HREF="index.html#f019"> <sup>19</sup></A> Colonial gardens also played an 
            important role in romantic "historical" tales of everyday life in colonial 
            times; the tending of gardens was associated with self-sufficiency and a 
            simpler, nobler lifestyle. <A HREF="index.html#f020"> <sup>20</sup></A></DIV>
         
         
         <DIV CLASS="para">The colonialization of the American garden extended to the larger landscape as 
            well. Colonial Williamsburg remains the most important full-scale reproduction 
            of a colonial urban design, although the underlying armature of many East 
            Coast cities like New Haven and Savannah is essentially that of colonial 
            times. During Williamsburg's reconstruction in the 1930s, both professional 
            and popular magazines documented its progress. <A HREF="index.html#f021"> 
               <sup>21</sup></A> Colonial Williamsburg was partially inspired by the 
            transformation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries of a 
            number of New England towns, like Litchfield, Connecticut, into idealized 
            versions of what colonial villages were thought to be. <A HREF="index.html#f022"> 
               <sup>22</sup></A> Colonial villages were often resurrected by 
            "colonializing" existing houses (through paint, shutters, molding and windows) 
            and creating village greens where none had previously existed. Such romantic 
            visions had little in common with historical predecessors, but their 
            popularity, demonstrated by "museum villages" like Old Sturbridge Village and 
            Historic Deerfield, led to the development of a pervasive stereotype. Many 
            recent communities, designed under the rubric of "New Urbanism," consciously 
            seek to integrate planning ideas (and sometimes building styles) from these 
            Colonial Revival towns. <A HREF="index.html#f023"> <sup>23</sup></A></DIV>
         
         
         
         <DIV CLASS="para">The Colonial Revival has also influenced American art, but it is difficult to 
            characterize a colonial revival "movement" in art analogous to that in 
            architecture and the decorative arts. In the art world, there was no 
            discussion of the inherent value of painting in the manner of colonial 
            artists, nor was there any particular effort to reemphasize the subject matter 
            of colonial painting. In other words, the fundamental essence of the 
            architectural colonial revival - to revive the spirit of colonial architecture 
            through direct imitation or inspired emulation - had no counterpart in art and 
            sculpture. Instead, the colonial manifested itself in other ways. For example, 
            a small group of painters produced colonial genre scenes around the turn of 
            the century depicting quaint domestic scenes that emphasized period costumes 
            and furniture. <A HREF="index.html#f024"> <sup>24</sup></A> These works catered 
            to a growing national nostalgia. They also had the effect of domesticating and 
            personalizing history for the average person. <A HREF="index.html#f025"> 
               <sup>25</sup></A> The same can be said for Wallace Nutting's 
            extraordinarily popular photographs of faux-colonial scenes. <A HREF="index.html#f026"> <sup>26</sup></A> Unfortunately, there is a shortage of 
            corresponding literature on these works - they appear almost exclusively in 
            exhibition catalogs or artist biographies. A few historical or genre paintings 
            were included in American art surveys, and artistic journals published short 
            descriptive essays on the work of individual artists, but no insightful 
            analyses exist until the late twentieth century. <A HREF="index.html#f027">

            encounter Colonial Revival art through illustrations in popular magazines like

         <DIV CLASS="para">A similar situation exists in the field of sculpture, where a few statues were 
            created of historical figures (e.g., George Washington) or with colonial 
            subject matter (Daniel Chester French's The Minuteman) during the period of 
            the most intense Colonial Revival between 1880 and 1930. Because of the public 
            nature of sculpture, there was probably more public contact with these 
            historical monuments than with Colonial Revival painting. The issue of 
            reproducing actual colonial sculpture was irrelevant since sculpture was 
            virtually non-existent before the Revolution. Unfortunately, unlike 
            architecture, no literature exists to analyze colonial-themed sculptural works 
            or disseminate them to a wider audience.

         <DIV CLASS="para"> The Colonial Revival has been associated with many ideas that range 
            beyond the revival or survival of a historical heritage. Since the expansion 
            of the national historic consciousness in the 1870s, promoters have used 
            Colonial Revival styles in art and architecture to advance notions of 
            patriotism, good taste, moral superiority, family life, democracy, and the 
            simple life.
         </DIV>
         
         
         <DIV CLASS="para">Patriotic qualities have been central to the Colonial Revival since the 
            earliest days. The 1876 Centennial generated a great surge of interest in 
            American history. These sentiments also inspired the birth of a cultural 
            Colonial Revival. <A HREF="index.html#f029"> <sup>29</sup></A> As architect 
            Robert S. Peabody declared in 1876: "With our Centennial year have we not 
            discovered that we too have a past worthy of study?" <A HREF="index.html#f030"> 
               <sup>30</sup></A> Colonial design in architecture and the decorative arts 
            was promoted as a unique artistic achievement. <A HREF="index.html#f031"> 
               <sup>31</sup></A> Of course, at the time "colonial" referred to the Anglo-
            Dutch colonies of New England and the Mid-Atlantic, and the art and 
            architecture so admired by the revivalists was almost exclusively English in 
            origin. In the process, racial identity became tied to the American colonial 
            past. When the flood of Southern and Eastern European immigrants began in the 
            late nineteenth century it engendered fear in some of America's Anglo-Saxon 
            Protestant population (particularly in the Northeast), which strengthened many 
            advocates' devotion to what was perceived as America's true "national" style. 
            <A HREF="index.html#f032"> <sup>32</sup></A> These feelings were intensified 
            during and after the First World War.

         <DIV CLASS="para">The patriotic aspect, which we might think of as the most salient quality of 
            the Colonial Revival, was quickly coupled with other associations. In 
            architecture and furniture design, the qualities of "refinement and dignity" 
            found in colonial examples, along with simplicity and proper proportions, were 
            considered by many a fresh counterpoint to the busy eclecticism found of most 
            Victorian work. <A HREF="index.html#f033"> <sup>33</sup></A> These qualities 
            linked colonial styles to the balance, symmetry and proportion of classical 
            architecture. Interest in the Colonial Revival was therefore equated with 
            timeless good taste. <A HREF="index.html#f034"> <sup>34</sup></A></DIV>
         
         
         
         <DIV CLASS="para">Non-aesthetic qualities were also important to the popular development of the 
            Colonial Revival. One of the first ideas to be connected to the movement was 
            "democracy." The wide variety of things that could be called Colonial Revival 
            - from shingle-covered shacks to great Georgian mansions, or simple rush-
            seated chairs to elaborate highboys - could be equated with the democratic ideal of unity despite diversity. Along the same lines, the Colonial Revival 
            decorative objects and furniture admired by consumers of elite culture were 
            also available to the lower classes, thanks to mass production. This allowed 
            colonial styles to "trickle down" to the masses so that everyone could get 
            their own small piece of history. <A HREF="index.html#f035"> <sup>35</sup></A> 
            The colonial became democratic in both ideology and marketing.

         <DIV CLASS="para">One of the most interesting associations attached to the Colonial Revival 
            concerned its ethical value. A sense of moral deterioration in the late 
            nineteenth and early twentieth centuries inspired many revivalists to surround 
            themselves with material products from what was considered to be a more 
            family-oriented period of American history. <A HREF="index.html#f036"> 
               <sup>36</sup></A> Writers romanticized the moral virtue of colonial life 
            through countless books and articles. <A HREF="index.html#f037"> 
               <sup>37</sup></A> Simplicity in furniture and architectural design was 
            equated with ethical superiority, as a counter to what many saw as the 
            decadence of Victorian culture, the breakdown of the family and the evil 
            threat of increasing industrialization. As Karal Marling states, much of the 
            architectural interest in the colonial past was "devoted to the regeneration 
            of American virtue through the restoration of the American home."<A HREF="index.html#f038"> <sup>38</sup></A></DIV>

         <DIV CLASS="para">The continuous popularity of the Colonial Revival in America since the 
            1870s is due to a number of factors. Patriotism or nationalism is certainly a 
            significant reason. The ethical argument - that furniture and architecture 
            from a more virtuous time has an inherent moral superiority - is also 
            important. In terms of aesthetics, much of the attraction to colonial 
            architecture is a result of its "correct" proportions and adherence to 
            classical principles. But economics has also entered into the equation. 
            Colonial reproduction furniture began to be mass marketed to the public in the 
            1880s. While intended to denote handcraftedness, the pieces were inexpensive 
            precisely because they were machine-made. Small inexpensive houses in various 
            colonial styles were also marketed to the mass public in the early twentieth 
            century. The Colonial Revival house, also known as "modernized colonial" for 
            its combination of historic appearance with modern functionality, peaked in 
            popularity in the 1930s. <A HREF="index.html#f039"> <sup>39</sup></A> These 
            simple houses were almost infinitely variable and required neither the 
            ornamentation of the previous century nor the expensive materials of the 
            budding modernist movement. In fact, the Colonial Revival achieved its most 
            enduring popular acceptance in the domestic sphere. The home became the center 
            of everything associated with the Colonial Revival. As a writer stated in 
            1899: "The American home is the object to which we may well give our best 
            thoughts and make it the place where religion and civilization shall dwell 
            together."<A HREF="index.html#f040"> <sup>40</sup></A></DIV>

         <DIV CLASS="para">In addition to these key trends indicated by the Colonial Revival 
            literature, there are some other tendencies worth mentioning. One of the most 
            important is the changing conception of what constituted the colonial period. 
            The early revivalists of the late nineteenth century loosely interpreted the 
            word "colonial" to include everything from the first settlers to the 1840s. 
            <A HREF="index.html#f041"> <sup>41</sup></A> What we now consider to be "Federal 
            Style" and "Greek Revival" were lumped together with early colonial and high 
            Georgian. Near the turn of the century, more precise investigators began to 
            differentiate pre- and post-Revolutionary styles, the former being "colonial" 
            or "Old Colonial" and the latter "Provincial," "Georgian," or "Federal." Into 
            the 1920s, however, the term "colonial" often described anything pre-
            Victorian. As researchers looked closer at older American design, a new 
            nomenclature developed that differentiated style by ethnic group ("Spanish 
            Colonial," "Dutch Colonial," etc.) and put more emphasis on the differences 
            between early work and the Georgian and Federal (or "Adam") styles that 
            followed.
         </DIV>
         
         
         <DIV CLASS="para">Another interesting aspect of the Colonial Revival is the shifting emphases in 
            the literature of the movement. Nineteenth century writers tried to direct 
            attention to the colonial period in their particular field, or created 
            romantic visions of an inviting and not-so-distant past. In the early years of 
            the twentieth century, most of the literature was produced by scholars 
            investigating the historical realities of colonial architecture, architects 
            promoting it as a legitimate contemporary style, producers marketing colonial-
            inspired products, or tastemakers advancing the style for various aesthetic or 
            ethical reasons. After the 1930s, a growing interest in the modernist 
            aesthetic slowed the production of Colonial Revival-oriented books and 
            articles, though the popularity of Colonial Revival architecture and furniture 
            with the general public never waned. The Colonial Revival virtually 
            disappeared from scholarly attention and popular magazines during the period 
            of modernist domination (1960s-1970s). In the 1980s, it reemerged as a 
            respectable area of study as well as a source of popular interest.

         <DIV CLASS="para">The available literature provides a substantial historical record for 
            tracing both academic and popular interest in the Colonial Revival. The early 
            writings tell us what revivalists thought was important about the artistic 
            past and why it should be renewed or extended. They also show us the extent of 
            the Colonial Revival's popularity before World War II. The rebirth of Colonial 
            Revival literature in the last three decades has included a group of scholars 
            who have begun to ask important "why" questions rather than merely describing 
            or promoting the style. Why did the Colonial Revival happen? What accounts for 
            its longevity? What were the specific characteristics of the movement in 
            different time fields, periods or regions? More of these "why" questions 
            should be asked. An especially fruitful area of inquiry involves the 
            relationship between the societal and cultural factors that have propelled the 
            Colonial Revival into prominence and sustained its popularity. Michael 
            Kammen's far-ranging work on America's development of its historical past can 
            serve as a guidepost for this type of analysis.<A HREF="index.html#f042"> 
               <sup>42</sup></A></DIV>

         <DIV CLASS="para">Gaps in the existing Colonial Revival literature suggest at least six 
            main areas of further emphasis. First, and possibly most important, is the 
            paucity of studies on the Colonial Revival's impact on fields other than 
            architecture. The amount of architectural literature is disproportionately 
            large. Perhaps this is a reflection of architecture's visual prominence in the 
            environment; whatever the reason, the other artistic fields have much ground 
            to make up. Second, more studies of non-English Colonial Revival arts and 
            architecture will help to further define the phenomenon. The focus of the 
            Colonial Revival in both scholarly and popular literature has always been 
            heavily weighed toward the Anglo-Dutch colonies of New England and the Middle 
            Atlantic States. With the exception of regional revivals in Florida, 
            California and the Southwest, non-English traditions have generally been 
            neglected. More work is needed on the legacy of other ethnic groups. <A HREF="index.html#f043"> <sup>43</sup></A> Third, the Colonial Revival's relationship 
            with popular culture needs more scrutiny. Some attempts have been made to do 
            this with particular building types, but the prevalence of Colonial Revival in 
            American popular culture as a whole is unexamined. <A HREF="index.html#f044"> 
               <sup>44</sup></A> Fourth, the possible influences of the Colonial Revival 
            on other areas of American arts and culture should be investigated. For 
            example, David Gebhard claims that the Spanish Colonial Revival architecture 
            in Southern California spurred the formation of avant-garde modernism among 
            architects in that area. <A HREF="index.html#f045"> <sup>45</sup></A> Fifth, 
            historians have generally overlooked the colonial genre and historical scenes 
            painted in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries as a source of 
            information on popular attitudes toward the past. <A HREF="index.html#f046"> 
               <sup>46</sup></A> These scenes obviously had a market; the forces that 
            affected public interest in such pictures need to be examined in more detail. 
            Finally, few works have compared the American Colonial Revival with revivalist 
            movements in other countries. Examining the experiences of other countries 
            with revivals of "national" or inherent artistic styles might shed light on 
            the true nature of our own ongoing infatuation with our colonial
            heritage.
         </DIV>
         
         
         <DIV CLASS="para">The Colonial Revival permeated art, architecture, landscape architecture, 
            urbanism, and decorative design - almost every human artistic endeavor. The 
            colonial period exerts a continuing influence on us, even at the beginning of 
            the twenty-first century. Unfortunately, the true nature of this important 
            influence is only partially understood. Hopefully, our evolving relationship 
            with the colonial past will continue to produce significant insights to 
            supplement the considerable body of Colonial Revival literature.
